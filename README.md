# TOOLBOX
A collection of (mostly javascript) snippets and d3 forms that I often use. It is helpful to have them in one place. Some notes:

- The idea is I can install this as a git submodule (versus installing it as a node module) and pull from it using browserify. That way, as I upgrade and improve these tools, those changes already are primed to be used in the next project. 
- Just about each of these has at least one dependency built in. Check the source code to see which ones and make sure they are installed, too.
- I use node/npm. These are almost all built to be used that way.
